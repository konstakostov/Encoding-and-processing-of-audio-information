    "The code reads an audio file using `wavfile.read()` and retrieves the sample rate and audio signal data. \n",
    "- If the audio signal is stereo (having multiple channels), it is converted to mono by averaging the channels. This is done to simplify further processing, as LPC analysis typically operates on single-channel signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 2. Define Frame Size and Hop Size**\n",
    "To process the signal in frames, the frame size and hop size (step between frames) must be determined. For example, a frame size of *1024* samples and a hop size of *512* samples are typical choices that balance resolution and smoothness.\n",
    "- `frame_size` defines the duration of each frame. A larger frame captures more of the signal but provides fewer ZCR points across time;\n",
    "- `hop_size` controls the overlap between frames. With a hop size smaller than the frame size, frames will overlap, allowing more detailed tracking of ZCR changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 3. Segment the Signal into Frames and Calculate ZCR for Each Frame**\n",
    "Using the frame and hop sizes defined, the signal is processed frame by frame. For each frame, the Zero-Crossing Rate (ZCR) is calculated based on sign changes.\n",
    "- The `range` function iterates through the signal in steps of `hop_size`, creating a new frame at each step;\n",
    "- For each frame, `np.diff(np.sign(frame))` identifies the zero-crossings, and `np.sum(zero_crossings) / frame_size calculates` the ZCR for that frame;\n",
    "- `zcr_values` stores the ZCR of each frame, producing a series of ZCR values representing changes across the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 4. Create a Time Axis and Plot ZCR over Time**\n",
    "A time axis for the ZCR values is calculated based on the sample rate and hop size. The ZCR values are then plotted over time, along with the original waveform, to visualize how ZCR varies across the audio signal.\n",
    "\n",
