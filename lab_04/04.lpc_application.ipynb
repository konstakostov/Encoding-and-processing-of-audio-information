    "#### LPC Vowel Synthesis\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 1. Load and Define Parameters**\n",
    "The code starts by defining key parameters like sample rate, duration, fundamental frequency, and formant frequencies to simulate a vowel sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `sample_rate = 16000`: Sets the sample rate to 16 kHz, which is typical for speech processing.\n",
    "- `duration = 0.5`: Specifies the length of the sound to be 0.5 seconds.\n",
    "- `f0 = 140`: This is the fundamental frequency of the simulated vowel (140 Hz is typical for a male voice).\n",
    "- `formants = [730, 1090, 2440]`: Defines the formant frequencies for vowel \"A\" (/ɑ/).\n",
    "- `bandwidths = [60, 90, 110]`: Specifies the bandwidths for the formants, determining their sharpness.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 2. Generate Glottal Pulse Train**\n",
    "A glottal pulse train is generated using the fundamental frequency. This models the source sound produced by the vocal folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `t = np.arange(0, duration, 1/sample_rate)`: Creates the time array.\n",
    "- `glottal_pulse_train = np.sin(2 * np.pi * f0 * t)`: Generates a sine wave at the fundamental frequency to simulate the excitation source (glottal pulses).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 3. Create Resonator for Each Formant**\n",
    "A resonator is created for each formant, which models the effect of the vocal tract on the sound. Each formant acts as a bandpass filter at a specific frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code uses formant frequencies and bandwidths to generate filters:\n",
    "    - `w = 2 * np.pi * f / sample_rate` converts the formant frequency to angular frequency.\n",
    "    - `r = np.exp(-np.pi * b / sample_rate)` calculates the pole radius (related to bandwidth).\n",
    "    - `a = [1, -2*r*np.cos(w), r**2]`: Defines the filter coefficients for the formant.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 4. Apply Each Filter**\n",
    "The glottal pulse train is passed through each filter corresponding to the formants, shaping the sound to resemble the target vowel.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `vowel_sound = lfilter(b, a, vowel_sound)`: Filters the glottal pulse train using the LPC filter created for each formant.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 5. Normalize the Output**\n",
    "After applying the filters, the synthesized signal is normalized to ensure it stays within the audible range.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `vowel_sound /= np.max(np.abs(vowel_sound))`: Normalizes the vowel sound by dividing by its maximum absolute value.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 6. Plot the Synthesized Signal**\n",
    "The final vowel sound is plotted in both time domain and frequency domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `plt.plot(vowel_sound[:500])`: Plots the first 500 samples of the sound waveform.\n",
    "- `plt.magnitude_spectrum(vowel_sound, Fs=sample_rate)`: Plots the frequency spectrum of the synthesized vowel sound, showing the formant peaks.\n",
