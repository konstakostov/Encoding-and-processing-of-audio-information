    "#### LPC Analysis and Visualization of Roots\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 1. Load Audio Signal**\n",
    "The code reads an audio file using `wavfile.read()` and retrieves the sample rate and audio signal data. \n",
    "- If the audio signal is stereo (having multiple channels), it is converted to mono by averaging the channels. This is done to simplify further processing, as LPC analysis typically operates on single-channel signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 2. Set LPC Parameters**\n",
    "An LPC order is defined, which specifies the number of coefficients to be calculated. \n",
    "- The LPC order affects the model's complexity and accuracy, with higher orders capturing more detail but potentially introducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 3. Calculate Autocorrelation**\n",
    "The autocorrelation of the audio signal is computed using `np.correlate()`, which measures how similar the signal is to itself at different time lags.\n",
    "- The resulting autocorrelation values are then trimmed to retain only the first `order + 1` coefficients, which are necessary for LPC analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 4. Implement Levinson-Durbin Algorithm**\n",
    "This section uses the Levinson-Durbin recursion to compute the LPC coefficients based on the autocorrelation values.\n",
    "- The algorithm initializes arrays for LPC coefficients and prediction error energy. It iteratively calculates reflection coefficients and updates the LPC coefficients and error energy, which helps in minimizing the prediction error for the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 5. Convert LPC to LSP Frequencies**\n",
    "The LPC coefficients are normalized, and the corresponding polynomials \\( P(z) \\) and \\( Q(z) \\) are constructed.\n",
    "- The coefficients are reversed, and then added and subtracted to form the two polynomials. This step is crucial for obtaining the line spectral pairs (LSP), which are a more stable representation of the LPC coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 6. Plotting Roots on the Unit Circle**\n",
    "A plot is created to visualize the roots of the \\( P(z) \\) and \\( Q(z) \\) polynomials on the unit circle in the complex plane.\n",
    "- The roots are calculated using `np.roots()`, and both sets of roots are plotted. The unit circle serves as a reference for analyzing the stability and characteristics of the system represented by the LPC coefficients.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 7. Show the Plot**\n",
    "Finally, the code customizes the plot by adding grid lines, labels, a title, and setting axis limits.\n",
    "- The plot is displayed to provide visual insight into the distribution of roots, which can be used to assess the stability and performance of the LPC model.\n"
