    "#### Exploring Stereo Width with Mid-Side Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 1. Load and Prepare the Stereo Audio Signal**\n",
    "Load a stereo audio file and verify that it contains two channels. If the file is mono, use a different stereo file for this exercise, as M/S processing requires both left and right channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 2. Apply Mid-Side (M/S) Encoding**\n",
    "In Mid-Side encoding:\n",
    "- The mid channel is the average of the left and right channels, capturing common information.\n",
    "- The side channel is the difference between the left and right channels, capturing spatial information.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 3. Adjust Stereo Width**\n",
    "After calculating the mid and side channels, adjust the stereo width by modifying the side channel's intensity. Increasing the side channelâ€™s amplitude boosts the stereo width, while decreasing it narrows the stereo image.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 4. Convert Back to Left and Right Channel**\n",
    "Convert the modified mid and side channels back to the left and right channels using the inverse of M/S encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 5. Plot Original and Adjusted Stereo Channels**\n",
    "Plot the original and adjusted left and right channels for a visual comparison of the stereo width adjustment effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Step 6. Save the Adjusted Stereo Signal**\n",
    "Normalize and save the adjusted audio to experience the effect of the width modification.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Set `file_name` with a file of your choice;\n",
